# Algorithms for Battery Management Systems Specialization in Python

- As I work through this Coursera Specialization offered through the University of Colorado, I am translating the provided Matlab code into Python: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms-for-battery-management-systems
- I am doing this to improve my understanding of the concepts and data related to battery management systems, as well as Matlab
- I'm sharing my python implementations publicly in case it is helpful
- At times I directly transcribe code, other times I create my own implementations that harness Python design patterns
